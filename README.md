TypeScript Logo By The Community
================================

I wanted to add a [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) sticker to my laptop but I could not find what I was looking for so I decided to create a typed superset of [logo.js](https://github.com/voodootikigod/logo.js).

If you like it use it, if you don't that's cool too. Just don't complain unless you want to offer a different one, post your alternative to twitter with the tag #tslogo.

I'm releasing this under a MIT license so you can print it on anything, use it anywhere, and never have to worry about royalties, licenses, and other such things.

Enjoy.
